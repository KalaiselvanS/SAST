#INSTRUCTIONS         |
#----------------------
#This file allows you to customize some of the labels found in the
#Fortify User Interface.  It is possible to customize the 'analysis'
#tags as well as the icons associated with those tags.  You may also
#Customize the names of the Buckets found in the Fortify Navigator view.
#To custmomize the labels use the values found in the Key below to map
#icons to the labels that you create.  Modify the string following the
# 'BUCKET' tag to customize the bucket names (11 char max).
#For Example:
#BUCKET0=Fix
#BUCKET1=Investigate
#BUCKET2=No Big Deal
#default=1
#ANALYSIS0=Not an Issue
#ANALYSIS1=Unknown
#ANALYSIS2=Exploitable
#ICON_FOR_ANALYSIS0=0
#ICON_FOR_ANALYSIS1=0
#ICON_FOR_ANALYSIS2=7
#This will relabel the buckets to read "No Big Deal, Investigate, Fix"
#There will be three options for the analysis of labels "Not an Issue,
#Unknown, Exploitable" and issues marked with one of those analysis' will
# show the icons (respectively) green circle, green circle, red circle with '!!'
#When an issue has yet to be audited the analysis selection box (in the summary view)
#will show a default value of 'Unknown'
